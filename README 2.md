# Extraction-Transformation-Loading-NewsApiData_using-Python

In this project I created a developer account in NewsApi to obtain the access token access keys to extract news articles based on keywords: Canada, Dalhousie University, University, Canada Education and Halifax. The extracted data is cleaned by removing URLs, special characters like hashtags, emoticons and processed in Spark to find the frequency count of certain words that matched with the given keywords like "education", "Canada", "university", etc. The data is then stored (loaded) manually in MongoDB.
